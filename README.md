# sainsbury-s
Sainsbury's

An attempt to the sainsburys online assesment test. To run the application one must navigate to the specific directory where the files have been downloaded. In the terminal you should type "mvn -clean install" to install the maven dependencies. After that type "javac JsoupTester.java" to compile and then type "java JsoupTester.java" to run the application.  
 
 The output is not as expected since it does not loop through all the data. 
 
 Additional steps would be to correctly execute the for loop, so that the data are added to the JSON. In addition some information is not parsed correctly from the page so that would be another issue to correct.
